	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is understood as time taken by the program to run and complete the task. As a programmer your goal should be to reduce the time complexity of the code by optimizing it and make it more efficient</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is known amount of memory occupied by the program.Example, if a program takes an array of size n, the space complexity of the program becomes O(n)</p>
